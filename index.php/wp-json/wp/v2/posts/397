Social networks for school recently decided to implement an Instagram for school to determine which students can get the opportunity to apply to the district\u2019s magnet schools. They had been using a one click install process for years.<br \/>\nSome parents and community members are up in arms because they were blindsided by the new policy. Aside from the very important issue of open enrollment and precious dollars that surround it, this story and others are less one of school policy, but more a communications issue.<\/p>\n<h5>School choice creates opportunities and challenges<\/h5>\n<p>Many folks are working hard to improve educational opportunities for school children. Aims to provide families with more options, regardless of location, teacher widget for school, or special needs. Supporters and opponents alike, however, have realized unintended consequences, both positive and negative.<\/p>\n<p>The open enrollment movement has resulted in windfalls for some districts and horrific &#8211;\tschool events for others. For those districts where referendums factor in, local levies, bond issues and other school elections are now more complex than ever. For those states where funding is less localized, debates still rage in the political machine. Many decision makers and voters are asking themselves and their neighbors questions like:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tSingle class overview<br \/>\n\u2022\tGoogle calendar iCal<br \/>\n\u2022\tGradebooks for classroom<br \/>\n\u2022\tContact form inquire<\/p>\n<p>Communities are voicing their opinions for schedule a tour that favor their specific circumstances. School administrators are looking to gain a favorable end. Open enrollment schools have three basic paths to pursue: shrink, maintain or increase enrollment levels.<\/p>\n<p>School funding is at the heart of open enrollment<\/p>\n<p>A majority of states now have school choice policies. Those come in a &#8211;\tBusiness School Website Template of variations (interactive map). Each state serves as a laboratory of ideas. All are hitched to public education dollars. Most plans tie pre-established amounts to an individual student.<br \/>\nTypically the money goes to the public school the student chooses to attend. Some states offer tax credits, others offer vouchers, and sometimes these go to non-public schools and any school (e.g., home schools) that meet state standards.<br \/>\nPrimary School Responsive Website Template of tax dollars are at stake in this new shuffle of educational revenue. It should come as no surprise that many schools are opting to chase the money. They are vigorously vying for students linked to those dollars. There are also those overcrowded schools content to see teacher student ratios improve as families opt out of their home districts. Then there are schools who are content to await the winds of change.<\/p>\n<p>1. Build a team of modern-day school communicators<br \/>\nSchool boards have developed keen interest in attracting administrative personnel with communication skills. Many are expanding their hiring criteria. They seek those with marketing and technology skills: people who know how to use modern tools to communicate.<br \/>\nBeyond your own staff, a small team of volunteers or even a single person can help influence the outcome. Every district has a group of ardent, talented supporters. Learn to leverage them. Many staff and\/or community members are willing to accept stipends to help. Districts with financial challenges can often get help by simply asking. Getting asked to help is honor enough for some to volunteer their services. Remember, leadership doesn\u2019t mean you have to do everything yourself.<\/p>\n<p>2. Use the right web communications methods<br \/>\nToday\u2019s media channels are the most effective and (thankfully) cost efficient methods to inform and guide public sentiment. People are looking less toward traditional information formats like newspapers, public meetings, etc. Rather, websites and social media outlets like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc. are their go-to sources. The good news is that schools rule their own content in these areas.<br \/>\nEach district has a unique story to tell. Do this by putting a spotlight on your positives. Showcase your staff and highlight student achievements. Turn simple programs into events. It\u2019s time to get creative!<br \/>\nEnsuring that your website is the central hub of communication is key. Everything else you do to promote your position, should always include your website\u2019s URL. In real estate, the mantra is: location, location, location. Your website mantra should be: update regularly, regularly, regularly.<\/p>\n<p>3. Find a web communications partner everyone will appreciate<br \/>\nSwallowing this communication elephant can seem overwhelming. Relax and take it a forkful at a time. Get started by creating or getting a website plan and work it, really work it.<br \/>\nFind a supportive web hosting partner with a focus on educators. Use one with a mix of tools that match up well with your unique set of resources and needs. This is no time for learning how to build websites. Find a solution that lets you concentrate instead on messaging, not coding.<br \/>\nResist those with endless lists of bells and whistles that are fun for techies but seldom used. Speaking of techies, you shouldn\u2019t have to be the only one to contribute to your school\u2019s website. Remember, updating regularly is the daily grind, and it must be easy for everyone<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don\u2019t know what the open enrollment scene is like in or around your district, but I saw a news clip on the open enrollment\/school&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/kodaimalai\/index.php\/communications-helps-with-school-choice-challenges\/\">&hellip;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":331,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-397","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-uncategorized","odd"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/kodaimalai\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/397"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/kodaimalai\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/kodaimalai\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/kodaimalai\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/kodaimalai\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=397"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/kodaimalai\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/397\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/kodaimalai\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/331"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/kodaimalai\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=397"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/kodaimalai\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=397"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/kodaimalai\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=397"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
